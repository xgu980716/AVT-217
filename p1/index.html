     <h1>Jane Taylor</h1>
     <h2>1806</h2>

         <p>Twinkle, twinkle, little star,</p>
         <p>How I wonder what you are!</p>
         Up above the world so high,
         Like a diamond in the sky.
      <p>
         When this blazing sun is gone,
         When he nothing shines upon,
         Then you show your little light,
         Twinkle, twinkle, through the night.</p>
      <p>
         Then the traveller in the dark
         Thanks you for your tiny spark;
         He could not see where to go,
         If you did not twinkle so.</p>
      <p>
         In the dark blue sky you keep,
         And often through my curtains peep,
         For you never shut your eye
         Till the sun is in the sky.</p>
      <p>
         As your bright and tiny spark
         Lights the traveller in the dark,
         Though I know not what you are,
         Twinkle, twinkle, little star.</p>
